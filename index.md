Hi! I'm Jose Duran, a clinical researcher and **software developer** from **Colombia.**

I live in **Boston** and work as a **postdoctoral research fellow** at **Harvard Medical School**. My main research interests are **robotic radiosurgery** and **immunotherapy**.

In terms of programming, I'm interested in the development of **software tools to help patients with chronic diseases**. 

I'm currently studying healthy tissue radioprotection in pancreatic cancer and the combination of immunotherapy and robotic radiosurgery in kidney cancer and melanoma.

The programming languages I'm using the most at the moment are **Javascript**, **Python**, and **R**.
