One of my goals this year was to finish freeCodeCamp's front-end material. As its name implies, freeCodeCamp is a free programming course that could be compared with a programming bootcamp. It was developed and is maintained by volunteers, and it's currently one of the most starred [repositories](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) on Github.

freeCodeCamp teaches you HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. That knowledge is then tested through programming challenges and projects of different complexity. I ended up completing the following projects:

* Websites: a [tribute](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/yaWOrx) page, a [portfolio](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/dpEORG)
* A [quote generating](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/eBvWpZ) web app
* A [weather](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/bYQLbZ) app
* A panel that shows you which [Twitch users](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/jGOmNV) are currently streaming
* A [Pomodoro](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/qPPdPr) clock
* A Wikipedia [viewer](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/QMYwxR)
* A JavaScript [calculator](https://codepen.io/jduran/full/WdZMVg/)
* A [tic-tac-toe](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/yPRvdP) game
* A [Simon](https://codepen.io/jduran/pen/Yrbvvg) game

Once you're done with all the challenges and projects, you are given a certificate. Here's mine:
